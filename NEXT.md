[^1]: We might use [*Textual*](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) for an interactive TUI. We should also default to the interactive TUI when running `translatepy` without any action specified.

[^2]: An actual public website was planned but due to the end of Heroku's free service and a lack of resource for now, we are going to stick with the local website (I think?). However the idea is not abandonned and a way of ranking the different translators based on real results is expected in the future.

> **Note**  
> Ideas with a `üßÉ` mark in front still need some consideration and might not be in the final product.
