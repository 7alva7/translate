[^1]: We might use [*Textual*](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) for an interactive TUI. We should also default to the interactive TUI when running `translatepy` without any action specified.

[^2]: An actual public website was planned but due to the end of Heroku's free service and a lack of resource for now, we are going to stick with the local website (I think?). However the idea is not abandonned and a way of ranking the different translators based on real results is expected in the future.

[^3]: For single word translations

[^4]: This provides a way of choosing the translators to use from the CLI (#53)
  But this also allows choosing the translator from the web server and thus the website.

[^5]: Refer to <https://github.com/Animenosekai/translate/discussions/62>

[^6]: Following #58

[^7]: Following <https://github.com/Animenosekai/translate/issues/28#issuecomment-918746811>

[^8]: Following #54

[^9]: Following #28

[^10]: The branch needs to be changed to fit the [`main`](https://github.com/Animenosekai/translate) branch (local website) and to have a CLI access

[^11]: Following #66

[^12]: Following #65
